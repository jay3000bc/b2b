**(1)** Errors to be presented in a nice way. For example, if a users session has expired, it shows a 404 error “The requested URL /mukesh/b2b/add-product was not
found on this server.” Which is not good.
**(2)** Under “Preferences” the last field is “General Info/ Message” - this should actually appear in “My Shop” page.

Open “My Shop” and the Logo is missing - here the Logo of that Seller should appear and not the usual B2B logo.

In “My Shop” page, on the left we have the title “My Shop” and on the right, there should be a link called “Shop Info” which when clicked should display the
Address, Phone number and Business Category of the Shop.
