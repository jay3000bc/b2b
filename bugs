**(1)** Errors to be presented in a nice way. For example, if a users session has expired, it shows a 404 error “The requested URL /mukesh/b2b/add-product was not
found on this server.” Which is not good.
**(2)** Under “Preferences” the last field is “General Info/ Message” - this should actually appear in “My Shop” page.

Open “My Shop” and the Logo is missing - here the Logo of that Seller should appear and not the usual B2B logo.

In “My Shop” page, on the left we have the title “My Shop” and on the right, there should be a link called “Shop Info” which when clicked should display the
Address, Phone number and Business Category of the Shop.
**(3)** In the Dashboard, Swap the 2 buttons “Page Views” and “Order Pending”. Check the functionality of “Page Views”.
**(4)** In the Dashboard, just like you have sections - Your recent Sales, Newly added Buyers. Please add another section as described below:

(a) For Sellers dashboard the section is called “My recent buyers”
(b) For Buyers dashboard the section is called “My recent suppliers”
